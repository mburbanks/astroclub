									<br />

									<br />
									If you’re reading this, the chances are you’ve just got yourself a Newtonian reflector, and have realized perhaps belatedly that “Newts” come with a problem: they need “collimating”.
									Which is to say, the optical components need lining up. BY YOU. Yikes, you think.
									<br /><br />
									Collimation Definition: Alignment and coincidence of the principal axes of the telescope's optical components: namely the primary mirror axis, and the eyepiece-focuser axis.
									<br /><br />
									When you buy a <i>refractor</i>, the object most people imagine on hearing the word "telescope", you naturally and reasonably expect all its optical components (lenses) to have been
									professionally aligned in the factory before delivery, and that you’ll never to have to adjust anything for the lifetime of the scope. Imagine buying a telescope where you have to
									align all the lenses yourself.
									<br /><br />
									Unfortunately, when you buy a Newtonian <i>reflector</i>, that is exactly what you get: an assembly of roughly-near-the-right-place components where the job of finely aligning everything
									is down to you. Also unfortunately, the image you'll see is highly sensitive to the correctness of the collimation. An out-of-collimation reflector will yield
									horrid views. That Newtonians get supplied like this seems wrong: a marketplace aberration that shouldn’t be allowed. Like delivering you a car whose
									wheels and suspension you have to align and tune yourself.
									<br /><br />
									There are in fact good reasons for this. Big Newtonians are designed to be regularly dismantled and re-assembled, requiring a recollimation every time. Their mirrors are thick slabs
									of glass which change shape as they change temperature outside at night, sometimes requiring recollimation even during an observing session!
									<br /><br />
									Luckily, collimating a Newtonian is not difficult, although it may seem so at first. There is no shortage of websites, books, articles and forums describing how to do it, nonetheless
									I still feel there is room for another one. None of the descriptions I’ve read strikes the right balance of what “things” you should do, why you should do them, how important they
									are, and the consequences of not getting one or another quite right. In other words, which steps are crucial, and which perhaps don’t matter so much.
									<br /><br />
									Before getting into the collimation process itself, it’s worth first describing a Newtonian, and various terms.
									<br /><br />
									- diagram of primary and its axis, same for secondary -
									<br /><br />
									Whilst the familiar Refractor has a glass lens at the front of the tube to divert and concentrate all the light striking any part of the lens area to a single point in the image,
									a Newtonian Reflector does the same light-bending-concentrating using a concave mirror at the back of the tube. The incoming light travels to the “bottom” of the
									tube, bounces off the big curved mirror and gets reflected into a converging cone back up the tube. Before it gets to the focal point, the cone gets reflected sideways by a
									small central flat oval mirror (the secondary), converging outside the tube and there creating the image. This sideways-reflection allows your head to not be in the way of the
									incoming light when you look at the image with an eyepiece placed in the Focuser, at the cost of a small obstruction to the primary mirror (a much smaller obstruction than your head!) caused
									by the secondary mirror.
									<br /><br />
									Thus, a Newtonian comprises a big main mirror, called the “Primary Mirror”. It has a “Secondary Mirror”, towards the open end of the tube, which is smaller, flat and
									elliptical (oval-shaped) and suspended on a “Spider”. Level with where the oval Secondary Mirror sits, there is a hole in the side of the main tube over which is attached the
									“Focuser”, which is itself an adjustable-length narrow tube into which an “Eyepiece” gets inserted.
									<br /><br />
									- pic/s of light cone -
									<br /><br />
									The Primary Mirror has an “optical axis”, which can be imagined as an invisible line rising perfectly vertically out of the exact centre of the mirror. This mirror sits on an adjustable
									frame (the “Primary Cell”) which allows it, and therefore its optical axis, to be tilted a few degrees in any direction. The Eyepiece-and-Focuser Tube also has an optical axis,
									running down its exact centre. This Eyepiece tube is fixed in orientation, so its axis cannot be directly moved around*. However, one purpose of the flat Secondary Mirror is to
									redirect the eyepiece axis down to the bottom of the main tube. Crucially, the Secondary Mirror CAN be moved around and tilted to effectively point the eyepiece axis at wherever
									is required at the bottom of the main tube. And this is the whole point.
									<br /><br />
									As stated above, “Collimation” is defined as “aligning/making-coincident the axis of the eyepiece with the axis of the primary mirror”. The eyepiece axis can be thought of as pointing “in and
									down” to the centre of the Primary Mirror. And the Primary Mirror axis can be thought of as pointing “up and out” away from the centre of the primary, to the centre of the
									eyepiece. One simply has to adjust the tilt of the secondary to point the eyepiece axis at the centre of the primary, and adjust the Primary Cell’s knobs to point the primary’s
									axis up to the centreline of the eyepiece.
									<br /><br />
									So, to summarize, collimation of a Newtonian comprises 2 tasks, with a preliminary one:
									<br /><br />
									<b>TASKS</b>
									<br /><br />
									Prelim: Place the secondary mirror in the correct position, astride the converging light-cone and "opposite" the focuser, to bounce the cone out sideways into the eyepiece tube;
									<br /><br />
									1:  <b>Align the Focuser to the Primary</b>: Aim the centreline of the eyepiece tube at the centre of the primary mirror, by tilting the secondary;
									<br /><br />
									2:  <b>Align the Primary to the Focuser</b>: Aim the vertical axis of the primary mirror back to the centre of the eyepiece tube, by adjusting the primary cell’s knobs.
									<br /><br />
									Relative importances: <2> is crucial to get as correct as you possibly can. <1> is also important, but more tolerant of small error. <0> is, by far, least important. Personally
									I don’t even count step 0 as “collimation” at all, merely a preparatory step. Getting this “wrong” merely excludes a bit of light from reaching the eyepiece: a Newtonian can
									be properly collimated and still have a badly-positioned secondary.
									<br /><br />
									Ease of action: <2> is extremely easy. <1> is quite easy. <0> can be extremely frustrating to achieve “perfection”, but need only be roughly visually “correct”, and there are
									anyway different definitions of what constitutes “correct”.
									<br /><br />
									<b>HOW TO DO IT</b>
									<br /><br />
									I’m going to describe how to "do it" twice. First will be basic “just do this and you’ll be fine” without too much discussion; second will involve more discussion about
									fine-tuning, with more preliminary steps, choices and provisos.
									<br /><br />
									<b>TOOLS</b>
									<br /><br />
									You will need some tools to perform collimation. I’ll describe how to collimate using each tool. The tools are:
									<br /><br />
									-	Collimation Cap (for step 2, and very roughly doing step 0 & 1)
									<br />
									-	Cheshire Eyepiece (can be used for all steps)
									<br />
									-	Concenter (for steps 0 and 1 and very roughly step 2)
									<br />
									-	Laser Collimator (for steps 1 and 2 – but beware!)
									<br />
									-	Others, for example so-called auto-collimators or camera-based ones I will not describe here, as yiu’re only likely to use these once you’re fully au fait with the whole process.
									<br /><br />
									For a starter-out, I strongly recommend the Cheshire, though I appreciate that many will be unable to resist the apparent ease and simplicity of a laser. However, lasers have a
									problem which in many/most cases will guarantee mis-collimation.
